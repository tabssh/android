## ✅ Recently Shipped

- **`8cd84dd91de1`** 🐛 OCI cloud account TLS cert pin persistence + Proxmox-style card layout — `OciCloudClient` now passes existing `tls_pin` from token JSON to `OciApiClient` and exposes `getCapturedCertSha256()`; `CloudAccountManagerActivity` adds `persistOciCloudPin()` called after every API operation to write updated pin back to Keystore; all hypervisor/cloud VM card buttons relabelled SSH/VNC; `XCPngManagerActivity` VMAdapter rewritten to show SSH + VNC buttons side-by-side for running VMs.
- **`4201ed1dae87`** 🐛 OCI cert pin persistence + MetricsCollector log noise — `OciApiClient` split into `identityClient` + `iaasClient` with separate `CapturedPin` holders; `pinnedCertSha256` stored as semicolon-delimited `"identity_sha;iaas_sha"` pair (backward-compatible); `getCapturedCertSha256()` returns merged set; `OciManagerActivity` persists pins after both `validateCredentials()` and `loadInstances()`; `collectPlatformInfo()` exception downgraded from `Logger.e` → `Logger.d`.
- **`375dad6465de`** ✨ Connection count tracking + cloud instance SSH credentials — `SSHConnectionService.onConnectionEstablished` increments `connection_count` + `last_connected` via atomic SQL (feeds "Frequently Used" sort); long-press on cloud instance row opens SSH credentials dialog (username/password/port/identity); creds stored in `SecurePasswordManager.ENCRYPTED` scoped to cloud account, never written to Room; `handleConnect()` builds transient in-memory `ConnectionProfile` from stored creds.
- **`27155abf89ba`** 🐛 Search on Connections tab fixed — `filterConnections()` now swaps adapter back to flat `adapter` before submitting results; prevents search submitting to detached `groupedAdapter`.
- **`64182c5fcd73`** 🐛 OCI credential persistence + import UX — `editor.apply()` → `editor.commit()` in `SecurePasswordManager`; `saveOrUpdateOciAccount` now checks `storePassword()` return and rolls back DB on Keystore failure; `ociConfigFilePicker`/`ociKeyFilePicker` re-show dialog on cancel/error instead of silently returning; `item_cloud_instance.xml` split into 2 rows of 2 buttons (row 3a: power+connect; row 3b: restart+force restart).
- **`1f994257bd17`** ✨ RequestTTY directive wired — `SSHConnection.kt` reads `advancedSettings["requestTTY"]`; PTY allocated for exec channels only when value is `"yes"` or `"force"`; shell channel always gets PTY. Semantics match OpenSSH.
- **`417d072`** ✨ Cloud Accounts Manager UI + Power Controls (A–H complete) — `CloudAccountManagerActivity`, `CloudInstanceAdapter`, 8 cloud client power actions, Start/Stop toggle, Restart/Force Restart, live instance state; OCI removed from Hypervisors spinner (stays in enum for DB compat); contextual connection failure toasts app-wide.

## 🔧 `advancedSettings` — SSH config directive status

| Directive | Parser | Stored | Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ProxyJump` / `ProxyCommand` | ✅ | columns | ✅ |
| `ServerAliveInterval` / `StrictHostKeyChecking` | ✅ | JSON | intentionally ignored (mobile keepalive + TOFU dialog own these) |
| `ForwardAgent` / `ForwardX11` / `compression` / `connectTimeout` | ✅ | JSON + columns | ✅ |
| `RequestTTY` | ✅ | JSON | ✅ — exec PTY gated on `"yes"`/`"force"`; shell always gets PTY |

## 🧹 Post-v1: Dead code removal

Do not do a broad dead code sweep before v1. The risk/reward is wrong — no user-visible gain, and one missed case (Room entity field, preference key, ProGuard keep rule, reflection target) causes a crash or silent data loss.

**After v1 ships:**
- Full dead code sweep — Android Studio "Inspect Code" + `grep -rn` cross-reference
- Never remove a symbol that appears in a ProGuard keep rule or is reachable via `findPreference("key")` string literals, even if static analysis shows zero references
- `HypervisorProfile.isXenOrchestra` — still actively used in `XCPngManagerActivity`; do not drop before API-type migration is done
