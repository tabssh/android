# TabSSH Feature Audit

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Goal:** Document every concrete user-facing feature in TabSSH, JuiceSSH, and Termius — categorise into "have / want / drop" so we can plan the path to parity.

**Operating principles:**
- TabSSH is **free + open source, MIT licensed, no feature gates**. Every Free/Pro/Plugin/Enterprise feature in JuiceSSH or Termius is a candidate for us to ship to everyone.
- **No Google services dependency.** Sync stays SAF-based (works on de-Googled ROMs).
- **Privacy first.** No telemetry, no cloud auto-discovery (AWS/GCP/DO host import is opt-in if at all).
- All current features are baseline. Anything new is additive.

## Suggested priority buckets (proposal — you decide)

### 🔥 Tier 1 — finish the half-done + quick wins
1. **Mosh** — wire backend ↔ UI (we have both halves)
2. **Find/search in scrollback** — daily use
3. **Per-connection environment variables** — easy, very useful
4. **SSH agent forwarding** — wire toggle to real implementation
5. **Reconnect button on disconnected tab** — replace auto-close as the only option
6. **Bulk import** — CSV/JSON/Terraform/PuTTY in addition to ssh_config we already have
7. **File-edit in SFTP** — open file → text editor → save back
8. **chmod editing in SFTP**

### 🚀 Tier 2 — meaningful new capabilities
9. **FIDO2 / hardware-key SSH auth** — YubiKey via USB-C/NFC
10. **SSH certificate auth** — OpenSSH cert files
11. **Telnet protocol** — legacy gear
12. **Workspaces (named tab groups)**
13. **Split view (multi-pane terminal)** — big tablet win
14. **Command palette (Ctrl+K) + quick switcher (Ctrl+J)**
15. **Custom theme GUI editor** (we have JSON I/O, give it a UI)
16. **Snippet variables: prompt-style `{?password}`**
17. **Broadcast input (interactive multi-host typing)**

### 🎯 Tier 3 — polish & nice-to-haves
18. Bottom-nav bar on phones (Termius-style)
19. Per-host color tags (in addition to group colors)
20. Auto-open browser on forwarded HTTP(S) port
21. Run port forwards without a terminal session
22. PIN code app lock (currently biometric-only)
23. In-app changelog / what's new
24. Per-host startup commands UI exposure (we have post-connect script field already)
25. Bluetooth keyboard polish + AltGr
26. Connection history view (separate from "last connected")

### 🧊 Tier 4 — speculative / situational
- True-color rendering verification
- Foldable layout
- Tablet top-tabs / desktop-style chrome
- SFTP tabs / drag-drop
- Cluster command live result streaming
- Voice-typing affordance
- Multi-host performance dashboard

### 🚫 Out of scope (unless you say otherwise)
- AI command generation / AI Agent (cloud LLM, privacy)
- AWS / GCP / DO / Azure auto-import (privacy + cloud creds)
- Team Vault / shared groups / SAML SSO / SCIM (SaaS backend)
- CLI companion (Android app only)
- Plugin SDK (built-in everything)
- Cross-platform desktop app (Android only)

### 🆕 Where we already lead
- Hypervisor management (Proxmox / XCP-ng / Xen Orchestra / VMware) — **none of them have this**
- VM serial console via hypervisor API (no VM network needed)
- 23 built-in themes (vs 6 / 10+)
- 1-5 row fully customisable keyboard
- SAF sync (works on de-Googled ROMs)
- Three-way merge with conflict UI
- Per-entity sync toggles
- Hardware-backed Android Keystore
- Screenshot protection
- Open source (MIT)
- Recursive folder transfer

---

## What this means for README + AI.md

After we settle which Tier-1/2/3 items we're committing to:

- **README.md** needs a "what's done / what's coming" rewrite — the current roadmap section is short.
- **AI.md** §17 (or new §18) should add a "feature parity tracker" pointing at this audit + the agreed scope.
- Existing CLAUDE.md "Recent Changes" entries describe history — leave intact, but the live status truth lives in TODO.AI.md.
